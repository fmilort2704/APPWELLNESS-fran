# Instructions:

- Run `python group.py` to cluster and label the datapoints
  - There's an option to run new datapoints on a saved model to get labels on values without retraining
- Run `get_user_grouping.py` later to get the labels for a specific user Id and time period
- Edit `config.py` to update grouping settings
- Update changes by running `pip install .` in root directory
