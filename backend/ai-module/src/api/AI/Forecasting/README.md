- Configure model and data settings in `config.py`
- Run model training, validation and testing with `FORECAST_AND_VALIDATE=True`
- Run model on all collected data from a dataset and predict future with `FORECAST_FUTURE=True`
  - This will also save this model if later wanted to load and predict new values without retraining
- Set `LOAD_SAVED=True` to run saved loaded data and model
